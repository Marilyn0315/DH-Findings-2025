# DH-Workshop-Notes

Notes for coding DH workshop
### Nov 19

#### As of now, learned basic construct of the command line.
Computational analysis may be able to track word frequency significantly faster, but it may not be able to accurately pick up on context of the word itself. Computer may miss certain word complexity and nuances.
- Voyant
- AntConc
- NVivo

*“I believe that the time is ripe for significantly better documentation of programs and that we can best achieve this by considering programs to be works of literature ... the practitioner of literature programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of style.”*  
Donald Knuth, Literate programming (1984), p. 9

**Python**

Benefits
- Generally more readable
- Easier to see problems in the code
- Processes data quickly

Constraints
- Automates certain functions which can limit what it can do
- Programmer friendly vs machine friendly

Observations
- Have to imput in code functions (while analyzing text) for the program that our brains would automatically do. Ex: I ignored words like 'the' and 'and' , but I would have to explicitly write this in the command line. 
- stopwords - words to be excluded
- io means input/output. input a file to generate an output
- Humans can separate strands of text, computer needs command line specification
- for loop - run the function until the requirements are met
- Note that computers 'think' in binary terms. Yes or no, never maybe and always objective
- Flow chart activity - yes or no, process of buying chocolate ice cream, the conditions that can be answered with yes or no to meet the requirements to buy ice cream
